# Currency Converter
![Currency Converter Screenshot](Currency%20Converter.png)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a currency converter that can convert the value of one currency into another based on the current market rates. This project is useful for travelers, businesses, and forex traders who need to exchange currencies or track changes in exchange rate valuations. Additionally, this project demonstrates the concept of object-oriented programming in C++, which is a powerful and widely used programming paradigm that allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Installation, Running, and Usage
The project is a C++ program and can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler. Users can follow these steps:

1. Copy the code into a C++ file (e.g., `currency_converter.cpp`).
2. Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio) to compile the code.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter currency names and values for conversion.

## Dependencies, Limitations, and Assumptions

### Dependencies
The project does not have external dependencies and is standalone.

### Limitations
The currency conversion rates are hardcoded within the program and may not reflect real-time rates.

### Assumptions
The user inputs the currency names using specific symbols ('a' to 'l') as mentioned in the pre-instructions.
